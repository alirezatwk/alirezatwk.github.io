## About Me

I am a first-year Ph.D. student at Indiana University, advised by [Prof. Heidari](https://homes.luddy.indiana.edu/mheidar/?_gl=1*1dop1tm*_ga*MTU4ODA3OTIxLjE2OTcxNTYzMDI.*_ga_61CH0D2DQW*MTcxMzQ3ODk3MC4xOS4wLjE3MTM0Nzg5NzAuNjAuMC4w).


My research lies at the intersection of qunatum computing and machine learning. With a big interest on leveraging the unique capabilities of quantum computers to address classical computational challenges more efficiently, as well as to tackle emerging quantum problems.

## Research Interests

- **Quantum Machine Learning:** Quantum Reinforcement Learning, Quantum PCA and Feature Selection
- **Machine Learning:** Cross Learning
